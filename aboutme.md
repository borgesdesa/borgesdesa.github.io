subtitle: Here is my journey (so far)
---

Born in the heart of Brazil, I'm now based in Dublin having moved here in 2019 to pursue a new life. My studies started in Linguistics and Literature University. Having studied for a year I then transferred for Graphic Design. After graduation, I moved to Sao Paulo, the biggest city in Latin America, where I worked as a designer. I then got hired by public service and started working with politics. That was when my duties expanded to social media manager and IT support. This experience gave me the opportunity to discover my passion for computing and system administration. In 2018, politic scenario in Brazil got really bad, it was then that I took the chance and moved to Ireland, where despite the weather I have always felt like home. In 2020, I began a Higher Diploma in Science Computing and I am now even more fascinated in this field, where I can see a bright future for myself.
