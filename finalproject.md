### **Abstract** 
This project consists in three main themes: networking, virtualization and data collaboration.
On the first chapter, I make a network design, establishing VLANâ€™s, servers, gateways, DNS, among others, in order to meet the requirements that the company expects regarding their departments and inner and outside communications. For this, the application Cisco Packet Tracer is used to emulate not only the network design but the whole configuration while providing the possibility of testing it.
For virtualization chapter, I set up NAT and internal Networks on virtual machines created on VirtualBox. One of these virtual machines are running Zentyal for requested network services such as security.
The data collaboration, where I make a connection between DPL and the external partner, is a topic where a different path was taken. The virtualization, network and security settings were made on Google Cloud. The software on top though, Mongo and Ubuntu, are still using open source, as requested.
In Mongo the data can be inserted, edited and shared between DPL and their partner YAC. The connection between these two companies was done through an intranet portal made with JavaScript, specifically node.js. The code of the portal is created and operated with Vue framework.
