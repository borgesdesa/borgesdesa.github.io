### **Overall** 

------

In 2020 I enrolled myself in the postgraduate programme offered by CCT College Dublin. The course enabled me to achieve the knowledge, skills and competencies required to earn a level 8 award in computing. I have learned fundamental programming in software development, knowledge needed to successfully design and implement a web site using modern client and server side technologies, apply structured database design principles at the conceptual, logical and physical levels, networking from basic LANs to Enterprise scale networks and the services that they support. Also Cloud skills needed underlying protocols, services and network topologies, system administration and the capacity of maintaining modern business IT architectures securing IT infrastructures against modern and future security risks. Those are just a few to mention besides mobile applications, algorithms and constructs, among others.
